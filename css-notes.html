      Creating a Css stylesheet
      To create a Css sheet we typically first want to create a directory file called css, and than within that css directory we want to create our css stylesheets we must make sure that they end with .css so that they are read as style sheets. After this we need to link our style sheet to our page.
    </p>

    <h1 class="subtitle">Linking Files</h1>
    <p class="maintext">
      &lt;head&gt;
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;link href="css/(whatever your files name is" rel="stylesheet" type="css/stylesheet"&gt;
      <br>&lt;/head&gt;
      <br>This is how you link your stylesheet to whatever webpage you are working on. Href stands for hypertext reference rel stands for relationship, and type tells our shell the type of stylesheet it is.

    <h1 class="subtitle">Css Terminology</h1>
    <p class="maintext">
      Css stands for Cascading style sheet. Css allows us to add design to our webpages.
      <br>
      <br>Declarations
      <br>A declaration is basically a rule, or a modifier we can add to large sections of similar code. To set declarations in css we use brackets {} this is what they look like. To make brackets into a declaration we simple put a element or a class name with a dot before it infront of it than give it properties set to the values we want them to be. It will look like this h1{color: blue;} or for a class .this-is-a-class{color: red ;} Notice that we don't use an equal sign we use a colon, and afterwards we use a semi-colon. The colon is basically our equal sign, and the semi colon tells us that their are more declarations to be read. when we have a lot of declarations together it is a declaration block.
    </p>

    <h1 class="subtitle">Indentation, and spacing</h1>
    <p class="maintext">
      Comments 
      <br>to write a comment in css you write /*THIS IS A COMMENT*/ on windows, and mac their are commands to automatically write comments on windows it is ctr + / and on mac it is cmd + /
      <br>
      <br>Indentation
      <br>When you are writing declarations in css your element and your first bracket will be on the same line, and than the following declarations will be indented once. every declaration will start from the beginning. It will look something like This
    <div class="examplebox">
      <p class="maintext">
        .class{
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;color: blue;
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;text-font: sans serif;

      <br>to make a box we need 3 properties, border, padding, maring, and content. In the middle is your content/text around that is padding, around that is border, and lastly surrounding border is margin.
      <br>border
