      &lt;&gt;
      <br>this is an opening tag
      <br>
      <br>&lt;/>
      <br>this is a closing tag
      <br>
      <br>Elements
      <br>Things that are housed within these tags are elements, or properties. Elements will be the first thing that is written in a tag, it is also its main identifier.
      <br>
      <br>Properties
      <br>You can give properties to your elements within tags this will modify things within that area of code.

    </p>

    <h1 class="subtitle">Html Indentation and Spacing</h1>
    <p class="maintext">
      When we are creating webpages we want to make sure that we use the same indendation, and spacing conventions throughout. Depending, on who you are working for, or what you are doing, you indentation may change. A great example is our spacing a lot of people use 4 spaces, some people use 2. I am currently using 2 because that is what the coding program epicodus has told me to do.
      <br>
      <br>When we have a tag within a tag we indent the tag in the center. This rule sometimes does not apply to &lt;!doctype> or &lt;html> this is because if we indent everything that it will show up way to the left of our page. This is also why a lot of people like to use the double space instead of the quadruple space.
      <br>
      <br>Whitespace
      <br>We want to avoid unnescassary whitespace. It is ok to leave spaces in code to seperate different functions, make code easier to read, and create divisions for easier access. Try not to use more than 1 whitespace.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="title">
    <h1 id="html-elements">Html Elements</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="textbox">
    <h1 class="subtitle">Webpage Elements</h1>
    <p class="maintext">Webpage Elements notes
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
      <br>&lt;html lang="eng-US"&gt;
      <br>&lt;/html&gt;
      <br> This will go in all of your Html projects this will tell whatever program you are on what they are reading in this case it is html. The lang="eng-us" will make our webpage more accessible to people, by telling browsers what language our webpage its in we make it easier to translate.
      <br>
      <br>&lt;head&gt;
      <br>&lt;/head&gt;
      <br>&lt;body&gt;
      <br>&lt;/body&gt;
      <br>The head element is what you will house all of your information, and links to your webpage files like if you are linking a css sheet, also for your title. The body is everything that will be showing up onto your page this will contain the sustenance of your webpage. Things that are contained in the head don't actually show up on the webpage it is more like the behind the scenes stuff that you want to effect your webpage like your css link sheet.
      <br>
      <br>&lt;title>title&lt;/title>
      <br>We can put this inside of our head tag this will change the title of our page to whatever is within it.
      <br>
      <br>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      <br>&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      <br>These are used to divide large sums of text we can also add classes to these to modify large areas of text. Div is what we will use when we are creating box models.
      <br>
      <br>Box models
      <br>To make a box model we will create a class that we wil put inside of a div it will look like this &lt;div class="box">. Than we will go in our style sheet and set a border color, type, and size, a padding, and a margin. That will create a box.
    </p>

    <h1 class="subtitle">Text elements</h1>
    <p class="maintext">
      &lt;h1&gt;
      <br>This is a header element
      <br>
      <br>&lt;p&gt;
      <br>This is a paragraph element
      <br>
      <br>&lt;ul&gt;
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ls&gt;stuff&lt;/ls&gt;
      <br>&lt;/ul&gt;
      <br>This is a unordered list whatever is within the ls tags will be the list items. To make it into an ordered list simply type ol instead of ul.
      <br>
      <br>&lt;strong&gt;Super strong&lt;/strong&gt;
      <br>This is an inline element you can put it around text that you want to be bold. you can also type in em instead this will make it italic.
      <br>
      <br>

    </p>
    

    <h1 class="subtitle">Linking Elements</h1>
    <p class="maintext">Linking elements can link different files to a page.
      <br><br>&lt;img&gt;
      <br>This will create a image on your webpage. This tag requires a value for src, and optionally alt. Src will be the image adress, and alt will be alternative text.
      <br><br> it will look something like this:
    </p>

    <div class="examplebox">
      <p class="maintext">&lt;img src="img/image.jpeg" alt="this is a image"&gt; </p>
    </div>
    
    <p class="maintext">
      &lt;a&gt;
      <br>This is a anchor element.This can add a link to text within it. This tag requires a value for href(hyperlinkreference). The value you will give href is the link to where you want it to go. When referencing within a page and not to an external link or internal file you will link it to an id with a # infront of it. When linking a image if you want it to be saved to your webpage you must save it to a folder called img than you must save the image with a name that ends in .jpeg .jpg. Than when referencing it you must write the entire path to navigate it to your img directory, and than to the picture itself.
      <br>
      <br>it will look something like this:
    </p>

    <div class="examplebox">
      <p class="maintext">&lt;a href="whateveryourlinkis#this-goes-to-a-internal-id>this is the text it will be linked to&lt;/a&gt;</p>

    <h1 class="subtitle">Text Properties, and Values</h1>
    <p class="maintext">
      id
      <br> This property can be given to something to allow it to be referenced. You can take the id you give something, and put it into a hypertext reference
      <br>
      <br>it will look something like This
    </p>

    <div class="examplebox">
      <p class="maintext">&lt;h1 id="our-id"&gt;random text&lt;/h1&gt;
        <br>&lt;a href="#our-id"&gt;The text that will be the link&lt;/a&gt;
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="maintext">
      <br><br>class
      <br>this can be added to text or text groups in divisions or spans to make rules or effect large groups of text within the same class. Typically this is used for css styling.

    <h1 class="subtitle">Creating a project for Html</h1>
    <p class="maintext">
      When creating a webpage we want a to make our main directory for the project which will just be the name of our project. Inside of our main projects directory we want to make a img file for any images we want to put in, a css file for any style sheets that we would like to add in, a readme with .md at the end so that it is read as markdown, our main webpage that will be the first one opened called index.html (this is automatically read as the main page/the homepage on github) and lastly all of our webpages that we want to make with the correct endings to make sure it is read in the code that we want it to be read in. After we are done with a project if it is going to be an actual webpage we want to get a MIT licence or some other form of licence for our website. If we are using github to publish our webpage we need to create a branch called gh-pages this is the branch that github will recognize as our website. If we decide to make our website on github the url will be my-username.github.io/repository-name. To update this we can just delete our gh-pages than create another branched named the same thing off of our main branch.
